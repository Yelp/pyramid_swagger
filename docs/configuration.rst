Configuring pyramid_swagger
===========================================

The pyramid_swagger library is intended to require very little configuration to
get up and running.

A few relevant settings for your `Pyramid .ini file <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/environment.html#pyramid-includes-vs-pyramid-config-configurator-include>`_ (and their default settings):

.. code-block:: ini

        [app:main]
        # Add the pyramid_swagger validation tween to your app (required)
        pyramid.includes = pyramid_swagger

        # `api_docs.json` for Swagger 1.2 and/or `swagger.json` for Swagger 2.0
        # directory location.
        # Default: 'api_docs/'
        pyramid_swagger.schema_directory = "schemas/live/here"

        # Versions of Swagger to support. When both Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 are
        # supported, it is required for both schemas to define identical APIs.
        # In this dual-support mode, requests are validated against the Swagger
        # 2.0 schema only.
        # Default: ['2.0']
        # Supported versions: '1.2', '2.0'
        pyramid_swagger.swagger_versions = ['2.0']

        # Check the correctness of Swagger spec files.
        # Default: True
        pyramid_swagger.enable_swagger_spec_validation = true

        # Check request content against Swagger spec.
        # Default: True
        pyramid_swagger.enable_request_validation = true

        # Check response content against Swagger spec.
        # Default: True
        pyramid_swagger.enable_response_validation = true

        # Check path is declared in Swagger spec.
        # If disabled and an appropriate Swagger schema cannot be
        # found, then request and response validation is skipped.
        # Default: True
        pyramid_swagger.enable_path_validation = True

        # Use Python classes instead of dicts to represent models in incoming
        # requests.
        # Default: Whatever the default is in bravado_core, currently True
        pyramid_swagger.use_models = True

        # Exclude certain endpoints from validation. Takes a list of regular
        # expressions.
        # Default: [r'^/static/?', r'^/api-docs/?, r'^/swagger.json']
        pyramid_swagger.exclude_paths = [r'^/static/?', r'^/api-docs/?', r'^/swagger.json']

        # Exclude pyramid routes from validation. Accepts a list of strings
        pyramid_swagger.exclude_routes = ['catchall', 'no-validation']

        # Path to contextmanager to handle request/response validation
        # exceptions. This should be a dotted python name as per
        # http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/glossary.html#term-dotted-python-name
        # Default: None
        pyramid_swagger.validation_context_path = 'path.to.user.defined.contextmanager'

        # Enable/disable automatic /api-doc endpoints to serve the swagger
        # schemas (true by default)
        pyramid_swagger.enable_api_doc_views = true

        # Enable/disable generating the /api-doc endpoint from a resource
        # listing template (false by default). See `generate_resource_listing`
        # below for more details
        pyramid_swagger.generate_resource_listing = false

Note that, equivalently, you can add these during webapp configuration:

.. code-block:: python

        def main(global_config, **settings):
            # ...
            settings['pyramid_swagger.schema_directory'] = 'schemas/live/here/'
            settings['pyramid_swagger.enable_swagger_spec_validation'] = True
            # ...and so on with the other settings...
            config = Configurator(settings=settings)
            config.include('pyramid_swagger')


generate_resource_listing (Swagger 1.2 only)
--------------------------------------------

With a large API (many Resource objects) the boilerplate ``apis`` field of
the `Resource Listing`_ document can become painful to maintain. This
setting provides a way to relieve that burden.

When the ``generate_resource_listing`` option is enabled
:mod:`pyramid_swagger` will automatically generate the ``apis`` section of
the swagger `Resource Listing`_ from the list of ``*.json`` files in the
schema directory. The ``apis`` listing is generated by using the name of the
file (without the extension) as the ``path``.

To use this feature, create an ``api_docs.json`` file in the schema directory.
This file may contain any relevant field from `Resource Listing`_,
but it **must** exclude the ``apis`` field. In many cases this
``api_docs.json`` will only contain a single key ``swaggerVersion: 1.2``.

.. _Resource Listing: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#user-content-51-resource-listing

.. note::

    Generated `Resource Listing`_ documents will not have the optional
    ``description`` field.

Example
~~~~~~~

Given a schema directory with the following files

.. code-block:: none

    api_docs/
    ├── api_docs.json
    ├── pet.json
    ├── store.json
    └── user.json

Previously you might have created an ``api_docs.json`` that looked like this

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "swaggerVersion": "1.2",
        "apiVersion": "1.0",
        "apis": [
            {
                "path": "/pet",
            },
            {
                "path": "/store",
            },
            {
                "path": "/user",
            },
        ]
    }

When ``generate_resource_listing`` is enabled, the ``api_docs.json`` should
be similar, but with the ``apis`` section removed.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "swaggerVersion": "1.2",
        "apiVersion": "1.0",
    }

:mod:`pyramid_swagger` will generate a `Resource Listing`_ which is equivalent
to the original ``api_docs.json`` with a full ``apis`` list.
