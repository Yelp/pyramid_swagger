2.2.1 (2015-08-20)

  the same format as successful responses. (Closes: #121)

2.2.0 (2015-08-19)
++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added ``prefer_20_routes`` configuration option to ease incremental migrations from v1.2 to
  v2.0. (See :ref:`prefer20migration`)

2.1.0 (2015-08-14)
++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added ``user_formats`` configuration option to provide user-defined formats which can be used for validations
  and conversions to wire-python-wire formats. (See :ref:`user-format-label`)
* Added support for relative cross-refs in Swagger v2.0 specs.

2.0.0 (2015-06-25)
++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added ``use_models`` configuration option for Swagger 2.0 backwards compatibility with existing pyramid views

++++++++++++++++++++++

**Backwards Incompatible**

* Support for Swagger 2.0 - See `Migrating to Swagger 2.0`_

.. _Migrating to Swagger 2.0: http://pyramid-swagger.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migrating_to_swagger_20.html

1.5.0 (2015-05-12)
++++++++++++++++++++++

* Now using swagger_spec_validator package for spec validation. Should be far
  more robust than the previous implementation.

1.5.0-rc2 (2015-04-1)
++++++++++++++++++++++

* Form-encoded bodies are now validated correctly.
* Fixed bug in `required` swagger attribute handling.

1.5.0-rc1 (2015-03-30)
++++++++++++++++++++++

* Added ``enable_api_docs_views`` configuration option so /api-docs
  auto-registration can be disabled in situations where users want to serve
  the Swagger spec in a nonstandard way.
* Added ``exclude_routes`` configuration option. Allows a blacklist of Pyramid
  routes which will be ignored for validation purposes.
* Added ``generate_resource_listing`` configuration option to allow
  pyramid_swagger to generate the ``apis`` section of the resource listing.
* Bug fix for issues relating to ``void`` responses (See `Issue 79`_)
* Added support for header validation.
* Make casted values from the request available through
  ``request.swagger_data``

.. _Issue 79: https://github.com/striglia/pyramid_swagger/issues/79

1.4.0 (2015-01-27)
++++++++++++++++++

* Added ``validation_context_path`` setting which allows the user to specify a
  path to a contextmanager to custom handle request/response validation
  exceptions.

1.3.0 (2014-12-02)
++++++++++++++++++

* Now throws RequestValidationError and ResponseValidationError instead of
  HTTPClientError and HTTPInternalServerError respectively. The new errors
  subclass the old ones for backwards compatibility.

1.2.0 (2014-10-21)
++++++++++++++++++

* Added ``enable_request_validation`` setting which toggles whether request
  content is validated.
* Added ``enable_path_validation`` setting which toggles whether HTTP calls to
  endpoints will 400 if the URL is not described in the Swagger schema. If this
  flag is disabled and the path is not found, no validation of any kind is
  performed by pyramid-swagger.
* Added ``exclude_paths`` setting which duplicates the functionality of
  `skip_validation`. `skip_validation` is deprecated and scheduled for removal
  in the 2.0.0 release.
* Adds LICENSE file
* Fixes misuse of webtest which could cause ``make test`` to pass while
  functionality was broken.

++++++++++++++++++

* Fixes bug where response bodies were not validated correctly unless they were
  a model or primitive type.

* Better backwards compatibility warnings in this changelog!

++++++++++++++++++

* Swagger schema directory defaults to ``api_docs/`` rather than being a required
  configuration line.

  expected, readable errors are raised.
* This changelog is now a part of the build documentation and backfilled to the
  initial package version.

++++++++++++++++++

**Backwards Incompatible**

* Initial fully functional release.

  to be ``Pyramid.request.application_url``.
* Void return types are now checked.


0.5.0 (2014-07-08)
++++++++++++++++++

  requests/responses against.
